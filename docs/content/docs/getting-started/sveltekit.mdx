title: SvelteKit
---

This guide will walk through setting up your first workflow in a SvelteKit app. Along the way, you'll learn more about the concepts that are fundamental to using the development kit in your own projects.

---

<Steps>

<Step>
## Create Your SvelteKit Project

Start by creating a new SvelteKit project. This command will create a new directory named `my-workflow-app` with a minimal setup and setup a SvelteKit project inside it.

```bash
npx sv create my-workflow-app --template=minimal --types=ts --no-add-ons
```

Enter the newly made directory:

```bash
cd my-workflow-app
```

### Install `workflow`

```package-install
npm i workflow
```

### Configure Vite

Add `workflowPlugin()` to your Vite config. This enables usage of the `"use workflow"` and `"use step"` directives.

```typescript title="vite.config.ts" lineNumbers
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { workflowPlugin } from "workflow/sveltekit"; // [!code highlight]

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [sveltekit(), workflowPlugin()], // [!code highlight]
});
```

  <AccordionItem value="typescript-intellisense" className="[&_h3]:my-0">
    <AccordionTrigger className="text-sm">
      ### Setup IntelliSense for TypeScript (Optional)
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="[&_p]:my-2">

To enable helpful hints in your IDE, setup the workflow plugin in `tsconfig.json`:

```json title="tsconfig.json" lineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... rest of your TypeScript config
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "workflow" // [!code highlight]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

</Step>

<Step>

## Create Your First Workflow

Create a new file for our first workflow:

```typescript title="workflows/user-signup.ts" lineNumbers
import { sleep } from "workflow";

export async function handleUserSignup(email: string) {
  "use workflow"; // [!code highlight]

  const user = await createUser(email);
  await sendWelcomeEmail(user);

  await sleep("5s"); // Pause for 5s - doesn't consume any resources
  await sendOnboardingEmail(user);

  console.log("Workflow is complete! Run 'npx workflow web' to inspect your run")

  return { userId: user.id, status: "onboarded" };
}

```

We'll fill in those functions next, but let's take a look at this code:

* We define a **workflow** function with the directive `"use workflow"`. Think of the workflow function as the _orchestrator_ of individual **steps**.
* The Workflow DevKit's `sleep` function allows us to suspend execution of the workflow without using up any resources. A sleep can be a few seconds, hours, days, or even months long.

## Create Your Workflow Steps

Let's now define those missing functions.

```typescript title="workflows/user-signup.ts" lineNumbers
import { FatalError } from "workflow"

// Our workflow function defined earlier

async function createUser(email: string) {
  "use step"; // [!code highlight]

  console.log(`Creating user with email: ${email}`);

  // Full Node.js access - database calls, APIs, etc.
  return { id: crypto.randomUUID(), email };
}

async function sendWelcomeEmail(user: { id: string; email: string; }) {
  "use step"; // [!code highlight]

  console.log(`Sending welcome email to user: ${user.id}`);

  if (Math.random() < 0.3) {
  // By default, steps will be retried for unhandled errors
   throw new Error("Retryable!");
  }
}

async function sendOnboardingEmail(user: { id: string; email: string}) {
  "use step"; // [!code highlight]

  if (!user.email.includes("@")) {
    // To skip retrying, throw a FatalError instead
    throw new FatalError("Invalid Email");
  }

  console.log(`Sending onboarding email to user: ${user.id}`);
}
```

Taking a look at this code:

* Business logic lives inside **steps**. When a step is invoked inside a **workflow**, it gets enqueued to run on a separate request while the workflow is suspended, just like `sleep`.
* If a step throws an error, like in `sendWelcomeEmail`, the step will automatically be retried until it succeeds (or hits the step's max retry count).
* Steps can throw a `FatalError` if an error is intentional and should not be retried.

## Create Your Route Handler

To invoke your new workflow, we'll have to add your workflow to a `POST` API route handler, `src/routes/api/signup/+server.ts` with the following code:

```typescript title="src/routes/api/signup/+server.ts"
import { start } from "workflow/api";
import { handleUserSignup } from "../../../../workflows/user-signup";
import { json, type RequestHandler } from "@sveltejs/kit";

export const POST: RequestHandler = async ({
  request,
}: {
  request: Request;
}) => {
  const { email } = await request.json();

  // Executes asynchronously and doesn't block your app
  await start(handleUserSignup, [email]);

  return json({ message: "User signup workflow started" });
};

```

This route handler creates a `POST` request endpoint at `/api/signup` that will trigger your workflow.

<Callout>
Workflows can be triggered from API routes or any server-side code.
</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Run in development

To start your development server, run the following command in your terminal in the SvelteKit root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once your development server is running, you can trigger your workflow by running this command in the terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST --json '{"email":"hello@example.com"}' http://localhost:5173/api/signup
```

Check the SvelteKit development server logs to see your workflow execute as well as the steps that are being processed.

Additionally, you can use the [Workflow DevKit CLI or Web UI](/docs/observability) to inspect your workflow runs and steps in detail.

```bash
npx workflow inspect runs
# or add '--web' for an interactive Web based UI
```

## Deploying to production

Workflow DevKit apps currently work best when deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) and needs no special configuration.

Check the [Deploying](/docs/deploying) section to learn how your workflows can be deployed elsewhere.

## Next Steps

* Learn more about the [Foundations](/docs/foundations).
* Check [Errors](/docs/errors) if you encounter issues.
* Explore the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference).
