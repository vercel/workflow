# Runtime Integration

This guide explains how Workflow DevKit integrates with JavaScript runtimes and frameworks at a fundamental level. Understanding these concepts is useful if you're:

- Building a custom adapter for a framework or runtime
- Curious about how the framework works under the hood
- Debugging integration issues
- Contributing to the project

<Callout type="info">
**Official adapters handle this automatically.** If you're using Next.js or Nitro, you don't need to implement any of thisâ€”the framework plugins take care of everything. We're actively working on adapters for more runtimes and frameworks.
</Callout>

## Core Integration Concepts

Every Workflow DevKit integration, regardless of the runtime, requires these fundamental components:

1. **Build-time transformation** - Compiling workflow/step files into executable bundles
2. **Runtime HTTP endpoints** - Routes that handle workflow and step execution
3. **Queue processing** - Background workers that process workflow/step invocations
4. **Storage backend** (World) - Persistent state and event log storage

We'll walk through each concept using Bun as a concrete example.

<Steps>

<Step>
## Example: Manual Bun Integration

To illustrate these concepts, we'll build a complete manual integration with Bun. This same pattern applies to any JavaScript runtime.

### Create Your Project

Start by creating a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir bun-workflow-app
cd bun-workflow-app
bun init -y
```

### Install `workflow`

```bash
bun add workflow
```

### Install a World backend

Choose a storage backend for workflow state:

<Tabs items={["Local (Development)", "Postgres (Production)"]}>
  <Tab value="Local (Development)">
    <CodeBlock>bun add @workflow/world-local</CodeBlock>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">For local development and testing. Uses the filesystem.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Postgres (Production)">
    <CodeBlock>bun add @workflow/world-postgres</CodeBlock>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">For production deployments with PostgreSQL.</p>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure the CLI

Create a `workflow.config.json` file:

```json title="workflow.config.json"
{
  "buildTarget": "vercel-build-output-api",
  "dirs": ["workflows"]
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Write Example Workflows

Create a workflows directory and an example workflow file to demonstrate the integration:

```typescript title="workflows/user-signup.ts" lineNumbers
import { sleep } from "workflow";

export async function handleUserSignup(email: string) {
  "use workflow"; // [!code highlight]

  const user = await createUser(email);
  await sendWelcomeEmail(user);

  await sleep("5s"); // Pause for 5s - doesn't consume any resources
  await sendOnboardingEmail(user);

  return { userId: user.id, status: "onboarded" };
}
```

We'll fill in those functions next, but let's take a look at this code:

- We define a **workflow** function with the directive `"use workflow"`. Think of the workflow function as the _orchestrator_ of individual **steps**.
- The Workflow DevKit's `sleep` function allows us to suspend execution of the workflow without using up any resources. A sleep can be a few seconds, hours, days, or even months long.

### Define Step Functions

Define the step functions for the workflow:

```typescript title="workflows/user-signup.ts" lineNumbers
import { FatalError } from "workflow";

// Our workflow function defined earlier

async function createUser(email: string) {
  "use step"; // [!code highlight]

  console.log(`Creating user with email: ${email}`);

  // Full Node.js access - database calls, APIs, etc.
  return { id: crypto.randomUUID(), email };
}

async function sendWelcomeEmail(user: { id: string; email: string }) {
  "use step"; // [!code highlight]

  console.log(`Sending welcome email to user: ${user.id}`);

  if (Math.random() < 0.3) {
    // By default, steps will be retried for unhandled errors
    throw new Error("Retryable!");
  }
}

async function sendOnboardingEmail(user: { id: string; email: string }) {
  "use step"; // [!code highlight]

  if (!user.email.includes("@")) {
    // To skip retrying, throw a FatalError instead
    throw new FatalError("Invalid Email");
  }

  console.log(`Sending onboarding email to user: ${user.id}`);
}
```

Taking a look at this code:

- Business logic lives inside **steps**. When a step is invoked inside a **workflow**, it gets enqueued to run on a separate request while the workflow is suspended, just like `sleep`.
- If a step throws an error, like in `sendWelcomeEmail`, the step will automatically be retried until it succeeds (or hits the step's max retry count).
- Steps can throw a `FatalError` if an error is intentional and should not be retried.

</Step>

<Step>

## 1. Build-Time Transformation

The first integration requirement is compiling workflow files into executable bundles. Run the CLI build command:

```bash
bun x workflow build
```

This generates the `.well-known/workflow/v1/` directory containing:
- `flow.js` - Workflow execution handler
- `step.js` - Step execution handler
- `manifest.debug.json` - Workflow metadata

</Step>

<Step>

## 2. Runtime HTTP Endpoints

The second requirement is exposing HTTP endpoints that the compiled bundles will call. Create a server that exposes these routes:

```typescript title="server.ts" lineNumbers
import { start, getRun, getWorld } from 'workflow/api';
import flow from './.well-known/workflow/v1/flow.js';
import step from './.well-known/workflow/v1/step.js';
import manifest from './.well-known/workflow/v1/manifest.debug.json' with { type: 'json' };

// IMPORTANT: Set PORT before calling getWorld() so the world backend knows where to send requests
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
process.env.PORT = String(PORT);

const server = Bun.serve({
  port: PORT,
  routes: {
    // Required: Workflow runtime endpoints
    '/.well-known/workflow/v1/flow': {
      POST: (req) => flow.POST(req),
    },
    '/.well-known/workflow/v1/step': {
      POST: (req) => step.POST(req),
    },

    // Your application endpoints
    '/api/signup': {
      POST: async (req) => {
        const { email } = await req.json();

        // Get workflow metadata from the manifest
        const workflowMetadata = manifest.workflows['workflows/user-signup.ts'].handleUserSignup;

        // Start the workflow using metadata, not the function itself
        const run = await start(workflowMetadata, [email]);

        return Response.json({
          message: 'User signup workflow started',
          runId: run.runId,
        });
      },
    },

    // Optional: Check workflow status
    '/api/runs/:runId': {
      GET: async (req) => {
        const run = getRun(req.params.runId);
        const status = await run.status;
        return Response.json({ status });
      },
    },
  },
});

// Start the background queue processor
const world = getWorld();
if (world.start) {
  await world.start();
  console.log('Background queue processor started');
}

console.log(`Server listening on http://localhost:${server.port}`);
```

### Key Points

**Setting the PORT environment variable:**
- The local world backend (`@workflow/world-local`) uses HTTP to trigger workflow/step execution
- It reads `process.env.PORT` to know where to send requests
- **You must set `process.env.PORT` before calling `getWorld()` or importing `workflow/api`**
- The port must match your server's actual listening port

**Using the manifest instead of importing workflows directly:**
- In a manual integration, you cannot import workflow functions directly (e.g., `import { handleUserSignup } from './workflows/user-signup'`)
- Workflow functions need build-time transformation to get a `workflowId` property
- Instead, use the generated `manifest.debug.json` which contains the workflow metadata
- Pass the metadata object to `start()` instead of the function itself

**Required Endpoints:**

Every runtime integration must expose these endpoints:

1. **`POST /.well-known/workflow/v1/flow`** - Handles workflow execution requests
   - Called internally when workflows need to execute
   - Imports and invokes the compiled `flow.js` bundle

2. **`POST /.well-known/workflow/v1/step`** - Handles step execution requests
   - Called internally when steps need to execute
   - Imports and invokes the compiled `step.js` bundle

3. **`POST /.well-known/workflow/v1/webhook/:token`** (optional) - Handles webhook/hook resumption
   - Allows workflows to resume from external HTTP requests

</Step>

<Step>

## 3. Queue Processing

The third requirement is starting background queue processing. The World backend's `start()` method begins processing queued workflow and step invocations.

## 4. Storage Backend Configuration

The fourth requirement is configuring a World backend for persistent storage. Set the storage backend via environment variable:

```bash title=".env"
# For local development
WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD="@workflow/world-local"

# Or for production with Postgres
# WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD="@workflow/world-postgres"
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
```

<Callout>
  Bun automatically loads `.env` files, so you don't need to use `dotenv`.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

## Testing the Integration

Start your server to test the complete integration:

```bash
bun --hot server.ts
```

Once your server is running, trigger your workflow:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"hello@example.com"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/signup
```

Check the server logs to see your workflow execute and the steps being processed.

You can also use the [Workflow DevKit CLI or Web UI](/docs/observability) to inspect your workflow runs:

```bash
bunx workflow inspect runs # add '--web' for an interactive Web based UI
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Understanding the Integration

This manual integration demonstrates the core concepts that any Workflow DevKit adapter must implement:

### 1. Build Process
The CLI compiles your workflow files into two executable bundles:
- **`flow.js`** - Workflow orchestration handler (runs in a sandboxed VM)
- **`step.js`** - Step execution handler (has full Node.js/Bun runtime access)

### 2. Runtime Endpoints
Three HTTP endpoints form the workflow execution contract:
- **`POST /.well-known/workflow/v1/flow`** - Receives workflow execution requests
- **`POST /.well-known/workflow/v1/step`** - Receives step execution requests
- **`POST /.well-known/workflow/v1/webhook/:token`** (optional) - Handles webhook/hook resumption

### 3. Queue Processing
The `world.start()` call begins background processing of queued workflows and steps.

### 4. Execution Flow
1. Call `start()` to create a workflow run and enqueue it
2. The workflow handler (`flow.js`) executes the workflow code in a VM
3. When steps are called, they get enqueued for separate execution
4. The step handler (`step.js`) processes each step with full runtime access
5. Results are stored in the World backend and replayed on workflow resume

<Callout>
**Framework adapters** like `@workflow/next` and `@workflow/nitro` handle all of this automaticallyâ€”exposing the endpoints, running the build process, and configuring the runtime. This manual approach shows what's happening behind the scenes.
</Callout>

## Adapting to Other Runtimes

The same integration pattern applies to any JavaScript runtime or framework:

1. **Compile workflows** using the CLI (`workflow build`)
2. **Import the generated bundles** (`flow.js`, `step.js`)
3. **Expose HTTP endpoints** at `/.well-known/workflow/v1/flow` and `/step`
4. **Start queue processing** with `world.start()`
5. **Configure a World backend** via `WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD`

Whether you're using Express, Fastify, Hono, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, or any other runtimeâ€”these are the core building blocks.

## Deploying to Production

For production deployments:

1. Use `@workflow/world-postgres` or another production-ready World backend
2. Ensure your environment variables are configured
3. Consider using a process manager or container orchestration
4. Set up monitoring and observability

Check the [Deploying](/docs/deploying) section to learn more about deployment options and World backends.
