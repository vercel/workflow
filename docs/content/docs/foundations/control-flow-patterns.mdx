# Control Flow Patterns

Common distributed control flow patterns are really simple to implement in workflows and require learning no new syntax. You can just use familiar async/await patterns.

---

## Sequential Execution

The simplest way to orchestrate steps is to execute them one after another, where each step can be dependent on the previous step.

```typescript lineNumbers
export async function dataPipelineWorkflow(data: any) {
  "use workflow";

  const validated = await validateData(data);
  const processed = await processData(validated);
  const stored = await storeData(processed);

  return stored;
}
```

---

## Parallel Execution

When needing to execute multiple steps in parallel, you can use `Promise.all` to run them all at the same time.

```typescript lineNumbers
export async function fetchUserData(userId: string) {
  "use workflow";

  const [user, orders, preferences] = await Promise.all([ // [!code highlight]
    fetchUser(userId), // [!code highlight]
    fetchOrders(userId), // [!code highlight]
    fetchPreferences(userId) // [!code highlight]
  ]); // [!code highlight]

  return { user, orders, preferences };
}
```

This not only applies to steps - since [`sleep()`](/docs/api-reference/workflow/sleep) and [`webhook`](/docs/api-reference/workflow/create-webhook) are also just promises, we can await those in parallel too.
We can also use `Promise.race` instead of `Promise.all` to stop executing the promises after the first one completes.

```typescript lineNumbers

import { sleep, createWebhook } from "workflow";

export async function runExternalTask(userId: string) {
  "use workflow";

  const webhook = createWebhook();
  await executeExternalTask(webhook.url); // Send the webhook somewhere

  // Wait for the external webhook to hit, with a timeout of 1 day,
  // whichever comes first
  await Promise.race([ // [!code highlight]
    webhook, // [!code highlight]
    sleep('1 day'), // [!code highlight]
  ]); // [!code highlight]

  console.log("Done")
}
```

## A full example

Here's a simplified example taken from the [birthday card generator demo](https://github.com/vercel/workflow-examples/tree/main/birthday-card-generator), to illustrate how more complex orchestration can be modelled in promises.

```typescript lineNumbers
import { createWebhook, sleep } from "workflow"

async function birthdayWorkflow(
    prompt: string,
    email: string,
    friends: string[],
    birthday: Date
) {
    "use workflow";

    // Generate a birthday card with sequential steps
    const text = await makeCardText(prompt)
    const image = await makeCardImage(text)

    // Create webhooks for each friend who's invited to the birthday party
    const webhooks = friends.map(_ => createWebhook())

    // Send out all the RSVP invites in parallel steps
    await Promise.all(
        friends.map(
            (friend, i) => sendRSVPEmail(friend, webhooks[i])
        )
    )

    // Collect RSVPs as they are made without blocking the workflow
    let rsvps = []
    webhooks.map(
        webhook => webhook
            .then(req => req.json())
            .then(( { rsvp } ) => rsvps.push(rsvp))
    )

    // Wait until the birthday
    await sleep(birthday)

    // Send birthday card with as many rsvps were collected
    await sendBirthdayCard(text, image, rsvps, email)

    return { text, image, status: "Sent" }
}
```
