title: Vercel World
---

The **Vercel World** (`@workflow/world-vercel`) is a production-ready workflow backend integrated with Vercel's infrastructure. It provides scalable storage, robust queuing, and secure authentication for workflow deployments on the Vercel platform.

The Vercel world is designed for production deployments and provides:

- **Scalable storage** - Cloud-based workflow data persistence
- **Distributed queuing** - Reliable asynchronous step execution
- **Secure authentication** - API token-based access control
- **Multi-environment support** - Separate production, preview, and development environments
- **Team support** - Integration with Vercel teams and projects

## How It Works

### Storage

The Vercel world stores workflow data using Vercel's Workflow Storage API:

- Runs, steps, hooks, and streams are stored in Vercel's cloud infrastructure
- Data is automatically replicated and backed up
- Storage scales automatically with your application
- Data is encrypted at rest and in transit

### Queuing

The Vercel world uses Vercel's distributed queue system:

1. When a step is enqueued, it's added to Vercel's queue service
2. The queue distributes steps across available serverless functions
3. Steps are executed with automatic retries and error handling
4. Failed steps are retried according to retry policies

### Authentication

The Vercel world uses token-based authentication:

- API requests include authentication headers
- Tokens are scoped to specific projects and teams
- Tokens can be environment-specific (production, preview, development)
- Authentication is handled automatically in Vercel deployments

## Deploying to Vercel

### Automatic Configuration

When you deploy to Vercel, the world is configured automatically:

```bash
npx vercel deploy
```

No additional configuration is needed, Vercel automatically:

- Selects the Vercel World backend
- Sets up authentication
- Configures project and team IDs
- Provides storage and queuing infrastructure

### Deployment Workflow

Deploy your application to Vercel using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npx vercel deploy --prod
```

Workflows run automatically:

- Use Vercel World in production
- Data stored in Vercel's infrastructure
- Steps queued and executed on Vercel's serverless functions

## Multi-Environment Support

The Vercel world supports multiple environments:

- **Production** - Your live production deployment
- **Preview** - Preview deployments for pull requests
- **Development** - Development environment testing

Each environment has isolated workflow data, ensuring that development and testing don't interfere with production workflows.

## Remote Access Configuration

To inspect production workflows from your local machine using [observability tools](/docs/observability), you need to configure remote access.

### Getting Authentication Tokens

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
2. Create a new token with appropriate scopes
3. Save the token securely

### Environment Variables

Configure remote access via environment variables:

```bash
# Set the target world
export WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=vercel

# Authentication token
export WORKFLOW_VERCEL_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-token>

# Environment (production, preview, development)
export WORKFLOW_VERCEL_ENV=production

# Project ID
export WORKFLOW_VERCEL_PROJECT=<project-id>

# Team ID (if using Vercel teams)
export WORKFLOW_VERCEL_TEAM=<team-id>
```

### CLI Flags

You can also pass configuration via CLI flags when using observability tools:

```bash
npx workflow inspect runs \
  --backend=vercel \
  --env=production \
  --project=my-project \
  --team=my-team \
  --authToken=<your-token>
```

Learn more about remote inspection in the [Observability](/docs/observability) section.

## Team Support

If your project belongs to a Vercel team, the Vercel world automatically integrates with team permissions:

- Respects team access controls
- Requires team-scoped authentication tokens
- Isolates workflow data per team

## Scalability

The Vercel world is designed for production scale:

- **Automatic scaling** - Handles any number of concurrent workflows
- **Distributed execution** - Steps run across multiple serverless functions
- **Global distribution** - Works with Vercel's global edge network
- **High availability** - Built-in redundancy and failover

## Security

The Vercel world implements security best practices:

- **Token-based authentication** - Secure API access
- **Environment isolation** - Production, preview, and development data are separate
- **Encryption** - Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Team permissions** - Respects Vercel team access controls

## API Reference

### createVercelWorld

Creates a Vercel world instance:

```typescript
function createVercelWorld(
  config?: APIConfig
): World
```

**Parameters:**

- `config.token` - Authentication token
- `config.headers` - Custom headers including:
  - `x-vercel-environment` - Environment name
  - `x-vercel-project-id` - Project ID
  - `x-vercel-team-id` - Team ID
- `config.baseUrl` - API base URL (default: `https://api.vercel.com/v1/workflow`)

**Returns:**

- `World` - A world instance implementing the World interface

**Example:**

```typescript
import { createVercelWorld } from '@workflow/world-vercel';

const world = createVercelWorld({
  token: process.env.WORKFLOW_VERCEL_AUTH_TOKEN,
  headers: {
    'x-vercel-environment': 'production',
    'x-vercel-project-id': 'my-project',
    'x-vercel-team-id': 'my-team',
  },
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

If you see authentication errors:

1. Verify your token is valid: `vercel whoami --token <your-token>`
2. Check token has necessary scopes
3. Ensure project and team IDs are correct

### Environment Not Found

If the environment is not found:

1. Verify the environment name (`production`, `preview`, `development`)
2. Check the project has been deployed to that environment
3. Ensure your token has access to the project

### Deployment Issues

If workflows don't work after deployment:

1. Verify `withWorkflow()` is wrapping your Next.js config
2. Check build logs for errors
3. Ensure workflow files are in the correct directory
4. Test locally first with [Local World](/docs/deploying/world/local-world)
