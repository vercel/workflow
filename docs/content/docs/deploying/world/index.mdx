# The World Interface

<Callout type="wip">

This page is a work in progress.

</Callout>

The workflow `World` is an interface that abstracts how workflows and steps communicate with the outside world, letting you build custom adapters and reuse them across different environments, infrastructure, and hosting providers.

## Choosing a World implementation

- By default, Workflow uses the [Local world](/docs/deploying/world/embedded-world) for easy local development.
- When deployed on Vercel, Workflow switches to the [Vercel world](/docs/deploying/world/vercel-world).

If you want to use a different World implementation, set the `WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD` environment variable to your desired World package's NPM name:

```bash
export WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=@my-namespace/my-npm-package
export MY_WORLD_CONFIG=... # implementation-specific configuration
```

## Built-in Worlds

Workflow DevKit provides two built-in world implementations:

- [Embedded World](/docs/deploying/world/embedded-world) - Filesystem-based for local development
- [Vercel World](/docs/deploying/world/vercel-world) - Production-ready for Vercel deployments

## Community Worlds

- [Postgres World](/docs/deploying/world/postgres-world) - Reference implementation for a multi-host PostgreSQL backend world.
- [AWS World](/docs/deploying/world/aws-world) - Reference implementation for serverless workflow execution on AWS infrastructure.
- [Jazz World](https://github.com/garden-co/workflow-world-jazz) - A full World implementation built on top of [Jazz](https://jazz.tools)
