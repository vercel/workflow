# Postgres World

<Callout type="wip">

This page is a work in progress.

<p />

<Callout type="info">

**This world is a reference implementation, not a production-ready product.** We do not recommend using it in production. However, you can definitely use it as inspiration for a real-world database-backed solution that might run workflow and step workers separately from the triggering applications.

</Callout>

The PostgreSQL world is a reference implementation of a [world](/docs/deploying/world) that's fully backed by PostgreSQL, including job processing (using [pg-boss](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss)) and streaming (using PostgreSQL's NOTIFY and LISTEN).

This world is designed for long-running processes, so it can receive and dispatch events from a PostgreSQL database, and isn't meant to be deployed on serverless platforms like Vercel due to that nature.


## Usage

Install the package and set the world target using the following commands:

```bash
# Install the package
$ npm install @workflow/world-postgres
# Set the world target environment variable
$ export WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD="@workflow/world-postgres"
```

## Configuration

Configure the world using the following environments variables:

| Variable                               | Description                                                  | Default                                         |

| `WORKFLOW_POSTGRES_URL`                | PostgreSQL connection string                                 | `postgres://world:world@localhost:5432/world` |
| `WORKFLOW_POSTGRES_JOB_PREFIX`         | Prefix for queue job names                                   | `workflow_`                                               |
