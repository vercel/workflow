# @workflow/world-vercel

Production workflow backend for Vercel platform deployments.

Integrates with Vercel's infrastructure for storage, queuing, and authentication. Handles workflow persistence and scaling in production environments.

Used by default for deployments on Vercel. Authentication and API endpoints are configured automatically in Vercel deployments.

Queue callbacks allow generic handler return values. Scheduling control is
interpreted only for ordinary queue messages, never for invocation-mode result
data. This adapter does not yet advertise the optional `invoke` capability.

## Custom dispatcher

HTTP requests (including the queue) default to a shared undici `RetryAgent` that handles connection pooling and retries. Pass a custom `dispatcher` to override it, for example, to tune undici on newer Node.js runtimes:

```ts
import { Agent } from 'undici';
import { createWorld } from '@workflow/world-vercel';
import { setWorld } from '@workflow/core/runtime';

setWorld(createWorld({ dispatcher: new Agent({ connections: 16 }) }));
```

## Caller user agent

Pass a `User-Agent` header to append a caller-specific product token while
preserving the world-vercel token:

```ts
import { createWorld } from '@workflow/world-vercel';

const world = createWorld({
  headers: { 'User-Agent': 'my-framework/1.2.3' },
});
```
